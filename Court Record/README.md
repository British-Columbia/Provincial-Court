## Access to Court Documents
As a general rule, all court documents are a matter of public record unless a legislative provision or court order restricts public access. Documents subject to a sealing order cannot be inspected by the public, including members of the media. Documentation pertaining to cases subject to a publication ban, may be inspected.

## Publication Bans
While the media, in general terms, has a constitutional right to publish information about cases, there are limitations on this right. The Court may impose a publication ban, for example to protect confidential documents or as required by legislation.

In order to check whether there is a publication ban in effect in a particular case, visit the [judgements page](https://github.com/koala4lif/Provincial-Court-of-British-Columbia/tree/main/Judgements) and press `Ctrl + F` or `Command + F`, then enter the docket number. If there is a publication ban in place for a particular case, an order to that effect will appear under the docket number of that case.

Penalties for breaching a publication ban includes prosecution for contempt of court.
