 **RULING**

With respect to the proceedings and evidence provided, this court finds the Defendant, LxveyyVibez, not liable, and henceforth, the plaintiff is not entitled to the relief on the Notice of claim. 

 **REASON FOR JUDGMENT**

When the evidence is thoroughly examined, you can see that the Plaintiff took no regard to the safety of others by impinging traffic (and potential traffic) and failing to move over even after that reasonable request was issued. This goes in correspondence to the claims of violating Traffic Law (By the Defendant) 

In regards to the Supervisor, it goes with question that an individual would be banned from the same department they work at, but when you put it in perspective, a banned user, if not banned by department policy, would still have the obligation to provide a Supervisor even with banishment in place. With real life implications, the Employee is always recommended to know their employer's contact information in order to settle these exigent circumstances.

All-in-all, the court finds that the Defendant did everything in his authority to rectify further damage, and negligence was indistinguishable on the Defendant's part.
