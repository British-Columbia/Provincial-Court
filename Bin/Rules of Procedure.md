## Foreward: An Introduction to the British Columbia Courts

### The Role of Citizens
Citizens are non-court officers. They may petition the court only for civil reasons such as claiming damages. Residents may benefit from the assistance of an attorney certified by the Law Society.

### The Role of Peace Officers
Peace Officers will execute warrants and enforce summons directed to them by the Court.

### The Role of Attorneys
Attorneys are Officers of the Court and as such, must act with integrity and professionalism while maintaining their overarching responsibility to ensure civil conduct. Attorneys must liaise with judges in order to set trial dates and ensure their client and the opposing counsel are present at the hearings set. Attorneys are subject to following the Code of Ethics and upholding the rule of law just as much as peace officers. 

### The Role of Judges
Judges are part of the branch of government made to ensure people follow the law. Judges must not act favourably towards either party, and must at all times seek to uphold the procedures laid out in this document, and any policies of the Court.

### The Role of the Provincial Court
The Provincial Court is the trial court in British Columbia with original jurisdiction over any actions. The Provincial Court hears civil cases, criminal cases, and applications such those for expungements and warrants. The Provincial Court may grant record expungements, issue criminal sanction, and other court orders. Cases appealed from the Provincial Court will go to the Court of Appeal for British Columbia.
