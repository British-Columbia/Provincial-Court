**JUDGEMENT**
	
On February 20th, 2022, user softcolby (hereinafter refered to as the "Petitioner") has come befoe the Court seeking an expungement of all his records. The petitioner request his records be sealed so he can join agencies within the City of Vancouver. The petitioner shows remorse and regret for perpetrating the crimes--showing evidence to stop criminality. The Crown's Attorney Office did not seek to contest and I concur with their decision. The Court trusts the petitioner is willing to change for the better good. Thus, the Court recognizes there is no reason to deny this application.

Therefore, the Court grants his application for expungement and the Court orders the following counts to be sealed from the criminal record of the applicant:
- [x] All.
