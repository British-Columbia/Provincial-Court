*By the Court:*
  
- A public agency is subject to an action for negligence under the *Torts Act of 2020* if the agency neglects to fairly and adequately review a properly filed complaint. However, the court would have no jurisdiction to impose upon that agency a particular burden of proof or review the correctness of the agency's disposition of that complaint unless that complaint alleges a *Charter* violation or discrimination based on protection grounds; that is, because of the Indigenous identity, race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, political belief, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or age of that person or because that person has been convicted of a criminal or summary conviction offence that is unrelated to the employment or to the intended employment of that person. 
  
- A private agency is not subject to an action for negligence under the *Torts Act of 2020* for an allegedly unsatisfactory conduct of internal grievance practices unless that grievance involves a *Charter* violation or discrimination based on protection grounds; that is, because of the Indigenous identity, race, colour, ancestry, place of origin, political belief, religion, marital status, family status, physical or mental disability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, or age of that person or because that person has been convicted of a criminal or summary conviction offence that is unrelated to the employment or to the intended employment of that person.
  
- The court has no jurisdiction to impose any disciplinary actions against an individual unless commanded to do so by law.
  
- The court has no jurisdiction to review a public or private agency's internal grievance practices unless commanded to do so by law.
