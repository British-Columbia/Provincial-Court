CRYPTIC, J. Delivered the Opinion of the Court:

*Held:* The version of C.B. 124 challenged by the appellant shall be declared unconstitutional and not in force. 

**Facts**

The Appellant in this matter raises a constitutional argument based on C.B. 124, a council by-law to rectify Numerous Problems as Related to Criminal and Traffic Offences, specifically subsections 3-4, arguing that the by-law makes Trespassing on Government Property an Indictable offense, which removes the discretion of law enforcement to issue fines, verbal warnings, or releases on undertakings, citing *Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship & Immigration)*, 2007 SCC 9, para. 19 and *Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford*, 2013 SCC 72. 

**Decision**

*Per Curiam:*

Police discretion exists in matters of criminal justice and is a response to, among other things, the communityâ€™s wish that not all those who commit minor offences should be arrested by the police or prosecuted. The police may exercise this discretion in respect of anyone as long as they do so honestly, transparently, and on valid and reasonable grounds (citing *R v. Beaudry*, 2007 SCC 5, para. 25), so it is important that the court weighs the value of police discretion, and what the charter states regarding laws involving life, liberty, and the security of all individuals, accused or not in conformity with the fundamental principles of justice.

The Charter provision in question is Part 2, Section 4. More specifically:

 - "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice."

In addition to this, the Appellant also makes the argument that it violates Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which states:

 - "Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be deprived thereof except in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice"

While there is no case law determining that the removal of discretion for certain offences is unconstitutional and not an affront to the principles of fundamental justice, there is, however, case law on gross disproportionality, one of the principles of fundamental justice. Gross disproportionality describes the case where the effects of the impugned law are so extreme that they cannot be justified by its object (see *Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford*, 2013 SCC 72, para. 35). Based on the aforementioned opinion, this Court can safely determine that the measure imposed by C.B. 124 at the 2023 version, violates the principle of Gross Disproportionality due to the unjustifiably extreme effects that the impunged law has. 

**Order**

Any individual charged with Trespassing on Govt. Property between December 3, 2023 and December 25, 2023, shall have that record as a **SUMMARY** offence rather than an indictable.
