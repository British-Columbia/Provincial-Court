**BACKGROUND ON PROCEEDINGS**
  
Applicant sought as relief an answer from the court as to the legality of a premier delegating powers of his office to a speaker of the assembly.
    
**JUDGEMENT AND REASONS**
  
This application for a prohibitory injunction is, in effect, an application for certified question--which should be filed with the Court of Appeal. 
	
I find applicant to lack standing to proceed with his application as he is neither the delegating premier nor the delegated speaker of the assembly; and applicant failed to indicate injury otherwise.

The application is moot as the alleged unlawful conduct of respondent allegedly occurred between January 1, 2022 and January 15, 2022.
	
**ORDER**
  
I will dismiss the application for a prohibitory injunction and decline to certify all questions presented.
