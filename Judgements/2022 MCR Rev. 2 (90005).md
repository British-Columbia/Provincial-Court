  **JOINT REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT**
  
  *Per* koalaMedvedeva, Doulx, zli_c, TacticalBlue66:
  
The circumstances of the matter is unprecedented, but correct standard to apply is to simply look at the enactment process and evaluate whether it is consistent with law. To this end, it is clear that the previous Vancouver City Charter was not lawfully enacted. Looking back to when the shift to a municipal government occurred, we see that a new mayor had been appointed by the developers: Mayor OhioAtm. Mayor OhioAtm drafted legislation that would become the charter, and his successor, Mayor Mpglasses, appeared to have passed the charter by himself despite there being no evidence that the procedures for enacting legislation had been changed by the transition to the municipal government. Proposed legislation cannot become legislation without a legislative body to enact it solely because there was no governing document outlining procedures for enactment. It is universally understood that the government does not have power to do anything unless it is granted that power; the government is not entitled to take any action simply because it is not specifically prohibited from taking that action. We can only conclude that the previous Vancouver City Charter was not lawfully enacted and is therefore to no effect.

Certainly there is no question that the term of an elected official cannot be modified while that officer is in office. By virtue of this, it is not plausible and thus unnecessary to consider the validity of a 8-month term. Instead, we must look to what the people intended when they elected Mayor mallyvibes. The court is not a legislative branch; we cannot set the rules and alter the law; we are only here to apply the law. We would need to determine what the people expected the mayor's term to be when they elected the mayor. All the evidence points to the de facto adoption of OhioAtm's charter, however unlawful it may have been. So although that charter was, in our opinion, never lawfully enacted, it was in fact what the people thought was in effect at the time of electing the mayor. As such, Mayor mallyvibes' term must be, consistent with the intent of the people, 3 months--ending on July 17, 2022.
  
  **CONCURRING AND DISSENTING REASONS**
  
  *Per* ElloNT:
   
The circumstances given to the Court is quite extraordinary, and frankly the court has no past statute or precedent to base this current decision after of. All we have is the reasonableness standard. When a government is abolished in a completely unprecedented form, in this case, a complete shift to a municipal government, there's absolute no basis that a new governing document may be passed. 

There are two important things to note in the "shift" in government: 

A. It was initiated by the founders.						<br>	
B. It involved a shift from a provincial to a municipal government.

The reason why this is important is that it takes away all and any previous parts of the government that this court can look into in order to base its decision off of. There is no law to "look" into. It is clear to the court that the founders intent was to completely gut and restart the government. Therefore, there is quite literally, 0 legal basis, even in real life, to look at when deciding this case.

If, hypothetically, the legislature had to approve such document, what procedure would happen to elect the new legislature to approve it? The new government established, is a completely new government leaving no reminisce of the previous one, led at the time, by solely one person: the mayor. Therefore, it's only reasonable to hold that the Charter introduced by the former Mayor was passed into law, despite the fact that there was no legislative body to approved it. I will also note that this is not a one size fits all solution. This is, in my view, with no legal basis to work on, a reasonable decision for a complex and ridiculous situation.

With that in mind, I would have ruled that the Mayor was elected and sworn in while the former Charter was in effect and is therefore subject to the 3 month term limit that it prescribes.
