**BACKGROUND**

The applicant was issued a warrant by Chief Judge KoalaMedvedeva (koala4life) [AW20231217] for discharging a firearm with intent to wound. The incident involved the applicant shooting at another person. 

**REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT**

**DEFINED STANDARD OF REVIEW**

Arrest warrants are adjudicated based on probable cause, meaning that evidence of a crime must be presented. *In re LeoMan080, 2023 MCR 185*

**CRIMES ALLEGED**

Discharging a Firearm with Intent to Wound is defined as: 

 - Every person commits discharging a firearm with intent to wound who discharges a firearm at a person with intent to wound, maim or disfigure, to endanger the life of or to prevent the arrest or detention of any person, whether or not that person is the one at whom the firearm is discharged.

**ESTABLISHED INTENTION**

This court will apply the definition of malevolent intention that was established by this court ***(see In Re LeoMan080, 2023 MCR 185)***, which has been given the following definition:

 - The intention to commit a crime against a person; the intention to inflict or attempt to inflict harm by physical or psychological means.

The applicant, in their statements, claim self-defence when it came to shooting a person. Selfâ€‘defence demands a broader societal perspective. Consequently, one of the important conditions limiting the availability of self-defence is that the act committed must be reasonable in the circumstances. ***(See R v. Khill, 2021 SCC 37)*** Therefore, this court must weigh the circumstances and determine whether the applicant's self-defence claim is supported by the current law, or is unfounded. Taking apart the situation, it looks like the driver of the pink F40 rammed into a dark pink Durango, which can be apparent if you see the clip (transcript) because an empty Durango seems to trail off into the sidewalk as soon as the clip started. While this would be dangerous because people are nearby, it does not necessarily make the shooting justifiable because the driver was not an immediate threat at the time of the shooting. In the applicant's arguments, they make it apparent that they intended to induce physical harm onto the driver, yet that inducement was not justifiable. Another circumstance is what happened after the ramming and what the applicant claims. The applicant claims that he felt his life to be endangered because the driver was constantly getting in and out of the vehicle, and approaching the back of the car. While these are suspicious mannierisms, it does not qualify for usage of deadly force if the driver has not caused immediate harm to warrant a designation of being a deadly threat. 

**RULING**

The Arrest Warrant and the Weapon Prohibition Order are **UPHELD** and remain in full effect, with the exclusion of the Arrest Warrant due to it being executed. The Weapon Prohibition Order remains in effect until the projected expiration date.
