**BACKGROUND AND ANALYSIS**

On March 4th, petitioner, HmmmMilton alleeged that defendant Myao2211 fasely arrested him for "Obstruction of a Peace Officer". The petitioner was on scene a High Risk Stop where Law Enforcement were aiming their firearms at a suspect and was asked to leave by the defendant. The petitioner failed to leave the area, which is why the defendant was cuffed and forcely removed. Thereafter, the petitioner came back to instead be near the suspect's vehicle that Law Enforcement were aiming their firearms at. Therefore, the defendant detained the petitioner for "Failure to Comply" and then arrested him for "Obstruction of a Peace Officer". 
	
During the pre-trial proceedings, March 17th, the defense submitted a motion to dismiss asserting that the petitioner was putting his life at risk because the scene was deemed to be high risk; thus, the arrest was justified and not false. This Court shall review the merits of this motion with acknowledgment of the governing instrument for this motion, that being the British Columbia Criminal Code, Code 1.07.
	
**LEGAL ARGUMENTS**
	
The defense stated in their reply to the motion to dismiss that the petitioner did not interfere with the High Risk Stop as he was standing on the sidewalk observing without any interference.  
	

**CONCLUSION**
