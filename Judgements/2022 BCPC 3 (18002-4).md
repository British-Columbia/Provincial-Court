**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**

Petitioner, Phantomy_TheKING, alleges that defendant, the British Columbia Sheriff Service, wrongfully demoted him from his position of superintendent in the British Columbia Sheriff Service on January 1, 2022. Petitioner files a claim of right to challenge disciplinary action pursuant to the *[REVISED] Employee Rights Act of 2021* (the “Act”) on the grounds that a proper disciplinary action document was not served to him and that the disciplinary action was in itself “wrongful”. 

**ARGUMENTS**

The first argument is that it is impossible to determine when the photographic evidence used by defendant to carry out disciplinary actions against petitioner were taken since they were not timestamped. This seems to be aimed at discrediting the evidence used by defendants, but looking to the Act, there is no provision requiring an employer to prove the time at which an alleged misconduct leading to disciplinary action occurred. Moreover, I am not convinced that the time of the alleged misconduct matters at all as the Act does not render the issuing of disciplinary action a time-sensitive matter, nor does it invalidate disciplinary action issued past a certain point in reference to the time of incident.

The second argument and one based in factual disagreement is that petitioner was only subject to one instance of “zero tolerance policy” (“policy”) as opposed to three as defendant would contend. I do not find this argument needy of much consideration as petitioner is arguing that disciplinary action was wrongful altogether; whereas the policy merely authorizes stricter disciplinary actions as opposed to authorizing discipline for conduct that would have gone undisciplined for someone not under such a policy.

The third argument is that petitioner’s conduct simply did not constitute radio immaturity. Petitioner provides explanations for why petitioner had spoken certain phrases or words. Although I do think his transmission was superfluous in many respects--such as specifying his agency, position, membership in certain units, and so on--and that perhaps most people would not have communicated on the radio the way he did, I must respect his employer’s determination that whatever his conduct, that it constitutes radio misconduct. Employers generally have a great prerogative in assessing and interpreting their employees’ conduct. Where an employer’s assessment or interpretation of their employees’ conduct is not flatly unreasonable, the court should not seek to change that assessment or interpretation and evaluate the conduct from his perspective. I do not consider defendant’s assessment and interpretation of petitioner’s conduct as radio misconduct to be flatly unreasonable.

The fourth argument is that petitioner had not violated a department policy on attire as he was authorized to be dressed the way he was. Petitioner points to a December 13, 2021 announcement that states “superintendents” “are allowed to utilize plain clothes”. A witness testified to the internal regulations of the British Columbia Sheriff Service requiring a “vest” to be worn “over their plain clothing”. That witness testified that the only exceptions to that uniform policy were not available to the petitioner. 

The fifth argument is that defendant had suspended petitioner for over 21 days, which would be inconsistent with the Act, despite the 3-day suspension stipulated in petitioner’s disciplinary action document. This point was not raised in petitioner’s notice of claim and is not helpful in determining the strict legality of defendant’s actions. I will disregard it.

The sixth argument is that defendant failed to provide a disciplinary action document that was in portable document format consistent with art. 2, s. 2(1)(a)(iii) of the Act. The court determines that the petitioner in fact was provided with a disciplinary action document consistent with the Act in his direct messages and was promptly and properly informed of his disciplinary action.

**JUDGEMENT**

Defendant, the British Columbia Sheriff Service, is not liable to petitioner, Phantomy_TheKING, for unlawfully issued disciplinary action. Defendant’s demotion and suspension of petitioner is upheld. Relief claimed by petitioner are denied.

**COSTS**

The court has generally waived costs or ordered that each party bears their own costs. In this case however, the many delays caused by petitioner and counsel warrants petitioners to bear their costs in addition to costs of the defendant. Upon consideration, I have determined that delays caused by petitioner and counsel costed defendant $2000 in additional attorney fees. I will also award defendants $500 for time spent attending to this matter that could and should have been avoided. 

**ORDER ON COSTS**

Petitioner and defendant will bear their own costs, and petitioner is ordered to pay defendant $2500 in costs.
