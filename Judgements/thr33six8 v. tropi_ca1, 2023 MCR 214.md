**INTRODUCTION**

[1] On November 5th, 2023, the plaintiff filed an administrative claim against the defendant alleging violations of the Vancouver Charter of Rights and Freedoms due to them being terminated by the Defendant for inactivity, which happened in October of 2023 (Oct. 1-2, 2023), according to the notice of claim.

[2] In the complaint, the plaintiff files the claim against the defendant for the following counts:

  - Violation of Rights, and;
  - Right to challenge disciplinary action.

[3] The relief being sought by the plaintiff is an injunction to be issued by the court to reinstate the plaintiff into the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, where the plaintiff was terminated.

[4] The plaintiff then appealed the disciplinary action to Mpglasses, the Superintendent of Internal Affairs, who denied the appeal on the grounds that the action was objective and that the appeal was initiated on the basis of emotional unrest, not objective fault. This court seeks to review this disciplinary action as a result. 

**RULING**

[5] For the torts alleged against the defendant, I hereby find the defendant **NOT LIABLE** for all civil counts. 

**REASONS FOR RULING**

[6] The plaintiff argues that because the defendant sought termination other than the alternatives, it is a violation of the Charter, supposedly allowing him to utilize his right to appeal. 

[7] When reviewing a disciplinary action, this court considers the following factors:

  - Whether the employer created reasonable policies that are visible to all employees,
  - Whether the employer proved more likely than not that the employee committed the violation(s),
  - Whether the employer allotted a reasonable timeframe by which the employee may defend themselves and notified the employee regarding the allegations, and;
  - Whether the employer followed a fair and standard disciplinary process that is consistent with all employees while issuing the disciplinary action.

[8] In this decision, this court will analyze each factor and apply these factors consistent with the circumstances of this case. The aforementioned circumstances may be modified through a case-by-case basis. Beginning with the first factor, the standards set out by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, the defendant's employer, is reasonable, and is visible for all employees, regardless of division. 

[9] The second factor states whether an employer has proven more likely than not that the employee committed the violation(s). This court adjudges that the employer has successfully proven a violation. The contents of a proper activity log according to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police make it clear that the employee must show their username on the leaderboard being on the correct team. The evidence submitted by the defendant of the plaintiff's submitted logs does not accurately reflect the contentd outlined in the RCMP's policies. And according to RCMP Policy, any employee who has reached a maximum number of strikes must be removed for Misconduct.

[10] The third factor states whether an employer allowed a reasonable timeframe by which the employee may defend themselves, and notified the employee regarding the allegations. According to a Transcript submitted by the plaintiff, the plaintiff was both notified of and given a proper time to defend themselves against the posted allegations. 

[11] The final factor states whether an employer has followed a fair and standard disciplinary process that is consistent with all employees while issuing the disciplinary action. This court adjudicates that the employer has in-fact followed a standard disciplinary process that is consistent with all employees while issuing the disciplinary action, and after. 

[12] With all appropriate factors being judged, the disciplinary action issued by the employer is upheld by this court. 

[13] The plaintiff, in their complaint and during their arguments, has forwarded a claim that the defendant also violated the Vancouver Charter of Rights and Freedoms. This claim is unfounded because it contains no provision of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms which dictates the claim. Therefore, the tort of "Violation of Rights" is not justiciable because it fails to mention a specific right that was violated in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms that the plaintiff alleges.

[14] With all that being said, the disciplinary action is **UPHELD** as this Court adjudicates the disciplinary action to be reasonable under the aforementioned circumstances, and no rights were violated because there was no right to be violated in the first place as the plaintiff has not made it clear what rights were violated.
