**INTRODUCTION**

On January 12th, 2024, the Crown accuses the defendant of the following:

  - s. 87, Recklessly Discharging a Firearm [Charged: x1]

The Court imposes the below-mentioned sentence to each count, including an additional order.

  - For Count 3, (x1), s. 92, the defendant is sentenced to 4 (240 seconds) minutes in a Correctional Facility, remanded to the custody of the Correctional Service Canada (Service Correctionnel du Canada).

Each sentence imposed shall be served concurrently. 

**ADDITIONAL ORDER**

WEAPONS PROHIBITION ORDER: The defendant is prohibited from selling, manufacturing, handling, or otherwise being in the possession of Firearms, expiring 3/7/2024. FAILURE TO ABIDE BY THIS ORDER WILL RESULT IN CRIMINAL SANCTIONS. ***See C.B. 116, s. 55***

**REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT**

Firstly, we have to understand the situation. The person recording the video (iiLittle_Law) neutralised the driver as they presented an obvious threat to life. After they were neutralised by the recorder (Who was a witness), the defendant began firing shots towards the vehicle, striking an officer. The struck officer then threatened to report the officer for firing at him, with the defendant apologising for striking the officer, proceeding to blow out the tires of the vehicle while a passenger was in the car the whole time.

Let's address the mitigating factors. During the sentencing hearing, the defence presents the mitigating factor that the accused is a law enforcement officer, however, the Court rejects this factor as being law enforcement only makes violations of use of force, or potential violations, worse than they are due to the training that law enforcement receive in the Rules of Engagement and Firearm safety. The mitigating factors the Court instead turns to is the possibility of crossfire, and the immediate remorse the defendant displayed upon realising they've accidentally struck an officer.

Finally, let's address the charges. Section 39 of C.B. 116, Offences By-law, states that a person commits careless use of a firearm who, without a lawful excuse, **uses**, carries, **handles**, ships, transports, or stores a firearm or any ammunition without exercising due regard for the safety of other persons that would be expected of a reasonable person or that a reasonable person ought to know. This Court asserts that the defendant is guilty on this count because the defendant did not take due regard for the safety of the passenger that a reasonable person ought to know, especially considering the defendant shot at the car when they approached the officer to apologise. Section 87 of C.B. 116, Offences By-law, states that a person commits recklessly discharging a firearm by doing one of the following acts:

  - Discharges a firearm in or at a building, structure, motor vehicle, aircraft, vessel, container, or trailer, knowing that or being reckless as to whether another person is present in that place; or

  - Intentionally discharges a firearm while being reckless as to the life or safety of another person.

For the purposes of making a proper evaluation of the circumstances, the Court resorts to both acts of commission due to the fact that it was previously adjudicated that the defendant acted recklessly without the due regard of the safety of the passenger of the motor vehicle. In addition to that, the defendant intentionally discharged a firearm at a motor vehicle being reckless as to whether or not a person is present in that motor vehicle. 

And finally, Section 92 of C.B. 116. Offences By-law, states that a person commits unlawfully causing bodily harm who unlawfully causes bodily harm to any person during the commission of another offence. Because it was adjudicated that the defendant was reckless when handling and using a firearm, striking an officer (causing bodily harm) while being reckless as to the safety of other persons as a passenger was still in the motor vehicle at the time the defendant shot out the tires to the vehicle. Therefore, the defendant caused unlawfully caused bodily harm during the commission of another offence.
