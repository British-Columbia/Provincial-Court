**BACKGROUND**

LeoMan080 has been issued an Arrest Warrant (AW20230907) for Illegal discharge of a firearm by Judge zli_c. The incident involved the applicant shooting a corpse for no reason at Sportiez, a location on Denman Street. Judgment below. 

**REASON FOR RULING**

**STANDARD OF REVIEW; WARRANTS**

Arrest warrants are adjudged and distributed based on the legal standard of probable cause, which means that there must be evidence that a crime has been committed in order for am arrest warrant to be sufficient. 

**CRIMINAL INTENT; CRIME IN QUESTION**

The criminal offence in question is Illegal Discharge of a Firearm (ยง6.04), which reads: 

 1. The act of illegal discharge of a firearm shall be recognized as an unlawful criminal offense in the City of Vancouver.
    
 2. Illegal discharge of a firearm shall be the act of intentionally discharging a firearm without legal means to do so, pursuant to current/future legislation.

The term "intent" as the relevant general law contextualises is to suggest that the malefactor must knowingly discharge a firearm without legal means to do so, although making a hard-and-fast definition is very unworkable and vague, therefore, it is up to the particular judge trying the case to individualise its definition as opposed to a narrower concept that is unlawful intent. ***See R v. Heywood, [1994] 3 SCR 761***

**INDIVIDUAL DEFINITION; HEYWOOD AUTHORITY**

The Supreme Court of Canada gives judges the sparing ability to define malevolent intention as making it black-and-white would be unworkable and vague. Therefore, exercising such a judicious power under the Heywood decision, I define malevolent intention in this case as:

 - **Malevolent intention** shall be defined as the intention to commit a crime against a person; the intention to inflict or attempt to inflict harm by physical or psychological means.

 - **Unlawful intention** shall be defined as the general intention to commit a crime not involving a person; or a crime against a person that results in minor or insignificant damage.

Seeing as the crime itself points more towards the mental state of the malefactor, and the fact that my individualised definition of malevolent intention is applicable, it's safe to say that the applicant does not possess the sufficient mens rea necessary for prosecution or trial for the exact crime committed, dissolving probable cause of the offence. 

**RULING**

The warrant for arrest is hereby **NULLIFIED** in full.
