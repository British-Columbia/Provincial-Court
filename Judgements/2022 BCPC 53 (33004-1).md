**JUDGEMENT AND REASONS**

Applicant, Dylatk1, is Overseer of Operations for Translink. He is an appointee of the Premier per art. 11, s. 6 of the *Constitution Act of 1867*. On January 29, 2022, applicant was dismissed by respondent, FatherLando_n, from his position. Applicant successfully provides prima facie evidence that the Constitution does not provide respondent with such authority. Respondent has been prompted by the court to respond to the application within 48 hours as of 9:14 am on January 29, 2022. Until a response is received and final judgement is made, the court sees fit to issue a preliminary injunction to preserve the status quo.
  
**ORDER**

I will grant applicant, Dylatk1, a preliminary injunction for stay of his dismissal as Overseer of Operations of Translink until 10:00 am on January 31, 2022.
