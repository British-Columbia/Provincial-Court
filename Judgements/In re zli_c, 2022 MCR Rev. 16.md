  **In the matter of an application for judicial review by zli_c**
  
*By the Court:*
  
*Held:*
  
- The Motion of No Confidence against Associate Chief Judge zli_c was lawfully passed;
- The entire Council isn't included to determine the threshold of a supermajority concurrence by definition of the Vancouver City Charter.

  **REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT**
  
  *Per* malachikeating (Doulx, iiCryptic_LawMD concurring):
  
There is no precedent for this type of situation before the Court, but the correct standard is to simply analyze the passing of the Motion of No Confidence to determine whether it is in accordance with the law. The passage of a Motion of No Confidence requires a supermajority concurrence; by definition, a supermajority concurrence is two-thirds of the City Council, counting those present, as well as those voting by proxy. Consequently, by this definition, a supermajority would fluctuate depending on whether members are present at the meeting or voting by proxy. Even though the Charter states "A confidence vote...shall require a supermajority concurrence of the Council," the definition is clarified in art. 2, s. 4 of the City Charter specifying that the threshold of the vote shall only be counted by those who are present or by proxy, and not by the entire City Council. By interpreting the entire City Council constitutes to the supermajority concurrence requirement, the majority of the laws currently in effect have been passed illegally and will need to be re-voted, thereby causing chaos and disorder.

As such, the Motion of No Confidence was passed lawfully and is therefore affirmed. 
	
**JOINT REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT**
	
*Per* iiCryptic_LawMD (malachikeating, Doulx concurring):

I would also like to note that in An Act to Amend the City Charter to Update Martial Law Declaration and to Fix the Council's Business Proceedings (See C.B. 17), s. 2(d)(ii) of that act states the following: *"Article II, Section IV, Clause B, Subclause II shall now state: A supermajority concurrence shall be recognized as two-thirds of the Members of the Council concurring or being in favor of said item and only counting those present at the sitting or by proxy."*

This amendment, in conjunction with art. 2, s. 4 of the City Charter, wholly upholds the use of proxy votes during Council business, ranging from a simple bill, to a No Confidence Motion against a Public Official; judges fitting into that category of a Public Official. 

Therefore, I am in total agreement of the Government's Motion to No Confidence, and thus far, it shall be upheld.
