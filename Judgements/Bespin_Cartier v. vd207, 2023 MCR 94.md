**BACKGROUND**

The petitioner filed all evidence and witnesses they intended to use at trial pursuant to Rule 4.1 of the Civil Rules of Procedure. The defendant's counsel then motioned for a summary judgment alleging that the evidence did not (1). Prove that the alleged tort happened. (2.) Prove that the defendant had anything to do with the alleged incident. The petitioner argues that the license plate and the time in the evidence presented refutes that claim. 

**ORAL REASONS FOR JUDGMENT**

The Supreme Court of Canada in Hryniak v. Mauldin, 2014 SCC 7, [2014] 1 S.C.R. 87 held that "Summary judgment motions must be granted whenever there is no genuine issue requiring a trial.  There will be no genuine issue requiring a trial when the judge is able to reach a fair and just determination on the merits on a motion for summary judgment.  This will be the case when the process (1) allows the judge to make the necessary findings of fact, (2) allows the judge to apply the law to the facts, and (3) is a proportionate, more expeditious, and less expensive means to achieve a just result." It is within the opinion of the court that all of these have been met. It is the petitioner's job to prove that it is probable that the defendant is in fact legally responsible for the torts presented against them. The court believes that it is not possible with the witness and evidence presented that the petitioner will be able to meet the burden of proof required for the court to find the defendant legally responsible. 

**RULING**

The defendant's counsel's motion for summary judgment is granted. The defendant is found not liable on one count of negligence.
