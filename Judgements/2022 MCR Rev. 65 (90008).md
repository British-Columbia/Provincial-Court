**REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT**

*Per* koalaMedvedeva (ElloNT, zli_c concurring):
  
With respect to the first question, we refer to art. 2, s. 4(b)(i) and (ii) of the City Charter, which states that in deciding Council votes, only the votes of Councillors "present at the sitting" may be counted; and art. 2, s. 4(c) of the City Charter, which states that every Councillor shall only "cast one vote". Accordingly, we find that a proxy vote--a vote cast by a Councillor at a sitting on behalf of another Councillor not at the sitting--is not permissable under the City Charter.
  
With respect to the second question, we refer to art. 2, s. 4(d) of the City Charter, which requires Council to maintain and publish a journal of "its proceedings and the votes...in all businesses". We interpret that to mean a record of the Councillors present at a session and the votes of each Councillor on every matter before the Council that session. The means by which Council should like to record and publish this information is their perogative, and the City Charter does not so prescribe a method.
