**JUDGEMENT**

The Court denies the application. It is not possible to infer the intent of a person merely pronouncing the term "LFA", short for "lethal force authorized", or any variation thereof. The evidence provided does not suggest common intention or abetment, nor am I convinced by it that the conduct depicted is an incitement to commit an offence.
