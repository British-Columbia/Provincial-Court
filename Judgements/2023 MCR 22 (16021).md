**COURT ORDER**

I am satisfied with the reasoning provided by adjudicator BrianRevelation that the disciplinary action issued to the petitioners weren’t reasonable pursuant to the *Revised Employee Rights Bylaw*. 

Therefore, it is imperative that both defendant AlejandroRuiz, and co-defendant the Vancouver Police Department and Covert Intercept Unit, are ordered to reinstate xXKenPlays to their former position and rank of Director and ACCEPTABLEADAM123 to their former position and rank of Deputy Director of the Covert Intercept Unit,  a subsidiary of the Vancouver Police Department.

Any person who is able to carry out any orders set out in this judgement may carry out such orders on behalf of the defendant and co-defendants without penalty. The orders contained within this judgement take effect immediately and must additionally be fulfilled by March 26. 2023 @ 10:25 pm EST. 

Additionally, I deny relief for tort 2.
