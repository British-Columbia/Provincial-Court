*Per curiam:*

  The trial judge correctly applied the law except when it held that "nothing in the *Revised Employee Rights By-law* requires formal investigations", in which case it misapplied the law. In fact, the by-law does require agencies to maintain some extent of standardised procedure for issuing disciplinary action. Specifically, the by-law delegates the responsibility of creating and enforcing a procedure and standard for issuing disciplinary action to the individual agencies. Nevertheless, this was not a substantial wrong as the trial judge subsequently found that an investigation did occur anyways.
  
  *Appeal dismissed.*
