**INTRODUCTION**

On May 12th, 2023, the Crown accuses the defendant of the following:

§ 6.03 - Careless Use of a Firearm - Count 1 - x1
§ 6.04 - Illegal Discharge of a Firearm - Count 2 - x1
§ 6.04 - Illegal Discharge of a Firearm - Count 3 - x2
§ 1.06 - Assault with a Weapon - Count 4 - x1
§ 1.06 - Assault with a Weapon - Count 5 - x2
§ 1.06 - Assault with a Weapon - Count 6 - x3
§ 1.06 - Assault with a Weapon - Count 7 - x4
§ 1.06 - Assault with a Weapon - Count 8 - x5

The ruling for each offense will be outlined.

**FINDING OF THE FACTS**

Witness testimony provided throughout the trial from direct examination and cross examination did not provide a clear-cut identity towards the aggressor, and did not confirm the defendant in this matter, LSFRChief, as the suspect. In witness testimony provided by a lay witness, BlueAaron8, thought that they defendant in the matter was JumboBlueLaws11158z, but counsel for the crown, iiCryptic_LawMD, corrected the defendant that it was LSFRChief, but this was never confirmed by the witness.

The witness, BlueAaron8 alleged that he heard one gunshot, and saw the defendant in this case deliberalty strike about 3 people with the baton. This fact is confirmed through another witness testimony per lay witness, AlexOtkerson777, he stated, and I quote, "LSFR shoots his gun then batons everyone".

Timestamped at 5:14 In exhibit A admitted by the crown, it shows an Individual pulling out his service issued sidearm, pointing it at the ground, and firing it three (3) times. The video is too pixelated and low quality (480p) to make out who this Individual is, and it was not proven by the crown counsel during examination of witnesses nor presentation of evidence.

Timestamped at 5:37 in Exhibit A admitted by the crown, it shows an Individual pulling out his service issued baton and striking three (3) individuals, physically striking one individual twice.

Timestamped at 4:51 in Exhibit A admitted into evidence by the crown, it shows two (2) Individuals withdrawing their firearm. It is not clear if there was an active threat or not as the video does not cover the entirety of the surrounding areas and a gunshot with distinctly heard in the distance, but it is unclear from where the gunshot came from.

In accordance to the Vancouver Criminal Code, Title 6, §6.03, Careless use of a firearm is defined as, and I quote, "Careless use of a firearm shall be the act of utilizing or transporting a firearm in a careless manner to the proper and reasonable handling of firearms, or without reasonable precautions for the safety of other persons without lawful excuse."

In accordance to the Vancouver Criminal Code, Title 6, §6.04, Illegal discharge of a firearm is defined as, and I quote, "Illegal discharge of a firearm shall be the act of intentionally discharging a firearm without legal means to do so, pursuant to current/future legislation."

In accordance to the Vancouver Criminal Code, Title 1, §1.06, Assault with a weapon is defined as, and I quote, "Assault with a weapon shall be the act of utilizing a deadly weapon to cause bodily harm to the another person."

**REASONING FOR JUDGMENT**

Throughout this trial, the crown counsel repeatedly failed to confirm the identity of the aggressor in every exhibit through witness, BlueAaron8, but a witness corroborated that it was infact, LSFRChief who discharged his service issued firearm and used his service issued baton to assault multiple individuals with it.

Witness BlueAaron8 stated, on the record, that it was his belief the witness was JumboBlueLaws11158z, then the crown cousnel corrected him and said "No, it's LSFRchief. Not jumbo". This was never confirmed nor denied by the witness therefore setting improper facts that the aggressor was allegedly the defendant in this case. After the crown counsel said that, the witness then stated, "He pulled it out but he never struck anyone with the baton". He took that statement back and said "he did struck some people now that I remember. But I think he struck everyone once. Except for me."

In the video provided through Exhibit A admitted in discovery by the crown, the video is pixelated and low quality (480p). In multiple parts in the video it is near impossible to make out the identification of the Individuals committing the criminal charges brought on, but was later corroborated, as aforemtioned, by witness testimony from a lay witness, AlexOtkerson777.

**CONCLUSION**

For Count 1, (x1), § 6.03 - Careless Use of a Firearm, the defendant is found: **Not Guilty**
For Count 2, (x1), § 6.04 - Illegal Discharge of a Firearm, the defendant is found: **Guilty**
For Count 3, (x2), § 6.04 - Illegal Discharge of a Firearm, the defendant is found: **Guilty**
For Count 4, (x1), § 1.06 - Assault with a Weapon, the defendant is found: **Guilty**
For Count 5, (x2), § 1.06 - Assault with a Weapon, the defendant is found: **Guilty**
For Count 6, (x3), § 1.06 - Assault with a Weapon, the defendant is found: **Guilty**
For Count 7, (x4), § 1.06 - Assault with a Weapon, the defendant is found: **Not Guilty**
For Count 8, (x5), § 1.06 - Assault with a Weapon, the defendant is found: **Not Guilty**

They shall be sentenced to 1,950 seconds (32.5 Minutes) in custody of the Correctional Services of Canada.
