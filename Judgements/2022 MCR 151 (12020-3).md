**JUDGEMENT**

In a civil action, the petitioner has the burden of proving his claims. Petitioner, VierVillinova, appears to have relied on the defendant's failure to justify his actions as reason for which he should be granted judgement. The court finds defendant not liable to all claims brought forth by petitioner.
