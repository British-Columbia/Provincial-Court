## **BACKGROUND**

On September 9th, 2023, iiLittle_Law was arrested by Detective w_ock of the Vancouver Police Department, Covert Intercept Unit (VPD:CIU) for Aiding and Abetting as a result of an incident arising on Chilco Street. After w_ock transported the applicant to the nearest booking location (Which, at the time, was the VPD station, w_ock explained how he had committed the offence, and was eventually booked on such charges.  

## **REASON FOR RULING**

### **STANDARD OF REVIEW; HABEAS CORPUS PETITIONS**

The rules dealing with habeas corpus should always be given a generous and flexible interpretation. An individual can properly invoke habeas corpus as a means of challenging increased or secondary detention even though success would not result in the release of the prisoner from a lawful primary detention. ***See Idziak v. Canada (Minister of Justice) [1992] 3 SCR 631***

### **CRIMINAL INTENT; CRIME IN QUESTION**

The criminal offence in question is Aiding and abetting (ยง7.02), which reads: 

 1. The act of Aiding and abetting shall be recognized as an unlawful criminal offense in the City of Vancouver.
    
 2. Aiding and abetting shall be the act of willfully and intentionally encouraging or assisting in committing or the planning of an offence, or failing to, without reasonable excuse, to notify law enforcement of the offence taking place.

The term "reasonable excuse" as used in relevant general law shall be interpreted as any justification that logically or legally absolves a victim's or witness' legal obligation to report a crime thereof. 

### **POLICE REPORTS; HOW TAKEN**

While the section in question allows for the prosecution or arrest for aiding based on either: 1) Directly, willfully and intentionally aiding in the commission of or in the premeditation of the crime thereof; or 2) Failure to report the crime thereof to law enforcement without a reasonable excuse, and while the latter section could or could not be applicable, the first part's applicability is wholly incorrect, which is what the language of the corresponding police report predominantly alludes to.

While a typo or a genuine (Actual) error does not inherently give rise for acquittal, if the crime is knowingly misapplied, which in this case, it has been knowingly misapplied, then that serves as a basis for acquittal because not only would it contradict the ongoing legal circumstances surrounding the applicability of the crime thereof, but it would also show that the law enforcer does not have an idea of what the law even is. 

### **EXCUSE REASONABILITY**

As the relevant general law provides, in order to be exempted from the legal obligation to report a crime, there must be a reasonable excuse. Applying the definition of a "reasonable excuse" this Court has previously laid out, the excuse must absolve the obligation by a logical or a legal standpoint. 

While there is no direct evidence pointing to a particular legal or logical circumstance by which the burden thereof must be absolved, there have been two (2) separate affidavits, a truthful testament, that suggests that the excuse is kidnapping. Because the applicant was kidnapped, there's no reasonable expectation to notify law enforcement due to the price you'd have to pay for it; your own life.

- [Affidavit #2 - ev11qs](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1M1mkcLoZRR9qsIlRmEZfU72mjeRZL5L6/view)

## **RULING**

The petition for habeas corpus is hereby **GRANTED** in full.
