**JUDGEMENT**

  HmmmMilton was issued a contempt warrant by the Hon. Judge Mallyvibes for an outburst by the petitioner. This court has to examine if the warrant was issued in good faith, and fairly distributing justice. The Supreme Court of Canada defines contempt of court in the following decision; *United Nurses of Alberta v. Alberta (Attorney General), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 901, 1992 CanLII 99 (SCC) [“United Nurses”]* (“The gravamen [substance] of the offence is not actual or threatened injury to persons or property … [it] is rather the open, continuous and flagrant violation of a court order without regard for the effect that may have on the respect accorded to edicts of the court.”) or in the case of; *Everywoman’s Health Centre Society v. Bridges, 54 B.C.L.R. (2d) 273, 1990 CanLII 5409 (BC CA) [“Everywoman’s“]* ([messes with the] “proper administration of justice")

  The court finds neither of these to be satisifed and as such **GRANTS** this application. **It is so ordered.**
