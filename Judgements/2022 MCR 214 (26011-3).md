**REASONS**
  
Although illegal discharge is not a lesser offence of assaulting a peace officer with a weapon or causing bodily harm, the former was committed during the commission of the latter offence. The accused has acknowledged his guilt in relation to the incident leading to the latter charge. The appropriate sentence is imprisonment as to count 2 and a suspended sentence as to count 4.
  
**ORDER**

Any authorized peace officer of the city of Vancouver or province of British Columbia is directed to take into custody ireallyyeet on the offence of assaulting a peace officer with a weapon or causing bodily harm.
