**INTRODUCTION**

On November 20th, 2022 at 7:13 PM in-game time (Crime commission timestamp), the Crown accuses the defendant of the following: 
  
  - § 1.06 - Assault with a Weapon - Count 1 - x1 
  - § 1.02 - Second Degree Murder - Count 2 - x1
 
The ruling for each offense will be outlined. 

**RULING**

For Count 1 (x1), §1.06 - Assault with a Weapon, the Defendant is found **GUILTY**

For Count 2 (x1), §1.02 - Second Degree Murder, the Defendant is found **GUILTY**

**REASON FOR JUDGEMENT**

Let's start off with Count 1, Assault with a Weapon. The Vancouver Criminal Code defines Assault with a Weapon as the following *(See § 1.06, subsection II)*:

*"Assault with a Weapon shall be the act of utilizing a deadly weapon to cause bodily harm to the another person."*

With that being said, the Defendant utilized his Firearm, a deadly weapon, to cause irreparable harm to an innocent civilian just casually in their vehicle at the Car Dealership. 

Secondarily, let's review Count 2, Second Degree Murder. The Vancouver Criminal Code defines Second Degree Murder as the following *(See § 1.02, subsection II)*

*"Second Degree Murder shall be the act of intentionally causing the death of a person, or committing an act meant to cause bodily harm that the offender knows is likely to cause the complainant's death that resulted in the death of a person."*

The Defendant committed Second Degree Murder by engaging in the knowing activity of killing an innocent civilian at the Car Dealership, which falls under the intentionality clause of the cited subsection in the Second Degree Murder charge.

**SENTENCE**

With all of that being said, the Defendant is hereby sentenced to 1250 seconds in a Provincial Prison.
