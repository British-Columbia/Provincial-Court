**JUDGEMENT**

With the following being disclosed, the arrest is determined to be **INVALID**. The reason for judgment will be disclosed.

**REASON FOR JUDGEMENT**

The Officers had little to no proper reason to fire their taser on someone who quickly brandished their firearm. It does not meet the required use of force threshold as police are taught. 

I can imagine that Officers are taught about the Use of force model, so tasering someone just for accidentally pointing their firearm is absurd. 

The charge(s) alleged against the petitioner in this arrest are hereby deemed nullified by the Court for the foregoing reasons above.
