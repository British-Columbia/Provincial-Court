**JOINT REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT**

  *Per* ElloNT (koalaMedvedeva, zli_c concurring):

The appellant brought up a case that can only be considered as ridiculous as the Atlanta Falcons choking a 28-3 lead.

**1. Authority of the Mayor**
  
Sections III.3.a of the City Charter describes the responsibility of the mayor to ensure the faithful execution of laws within the Executive .Furthermore, sections III.1.a and III.3.b authorize the mayor full control within the Executive to ensure the faithful execution of such laws. These sections deliver a clear implication that the City Charter prescribes the authority for the mayor to institute necessary regulation for the Executive in order to fulfill its prescribed duties.

**2. Cabinet Discretion**
  
In addition to the authority of the mayor, this court believes that cabinet members are held at an even further standard by the mayor - primarily because of the implications given within 111.4 of the City Charter. The charter explicitly gives the mayor power to vary departments, as well as emphasis on cabinet members serving at will (III.4.b.i, III.4.c). This makes it clear that the mayor has clear discretion to alter the cabinet at will in order to fulfill the responsibilities as the head of the Executive.

**3. Public and Private Speech**
  
Even removing the factors of mayoral authority, the speech that the appellant is arguing over isn't even protected. The purpose of freedom of speech is to protect against government censorship. The appellants speech was representative of the department he lead, which is under the Executive, and under the discretion of the mayor. The mayor is not censoring speech they are exercising the powers given to regulate speech that comes from the Executive.

**4. Relationship to the Given Circumstances**
  
The evidence attached to the dismissal of the appellant is clear - the appellant was dismissed over blatant insubordination. The argument that employment rights have any weight in this case is completely wrong - the City Charter supersedes any statute. In this case, the City Charter clearly authorizes the mayor power to control and alter the Executive to fulfill the responsibility to ensure the faithful execution of laws.
    
**JOINT REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT**
  
  *Per* koalaMedvedeva (ElloNT, zli_c concurring):
  
I agree with the court's joint reasons. We would stress that applicant's workplace speech in disobedience to respondent's directives is not protected by the Charter. We also hold that speech is equally protected in both government and private workplaces. 

Workplace speech is generally not protected as widely as applicant contends. There is no basis to claim that speech in private workplaces is protected to a lesser extent than that in government workplaces, and conversely, that speech in government workplaces is protected to a greater extent than that in private workplaces. Such an interpretation advanced by the applicant would require examination of the content of speech to determine whether a certain threshold of quality has been reached, and consequently, whether that speech should enjoy protection. Applicant has not proposed any test to make this determination, and we find this interpretation indeed unworkable.

In any case, respondent retains the perogative to choose and dismiss his staff with cause; in this case, insubordination. Analysis of justified infringement with respect to s. 1 is therefore unnecessary.
  
**JOINT REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT**
  
  *Per* zli_c (ElloNT, koalaMedvedeva concurring):

In section III, ss. 4 of the City Charter it states "The members of the cabinet shall serve at the pleasure of the Mayor and may be dismissed at will". The City Attorney can be removed at anytime deemed necessary by the Mayor at his/her discretion. If the Mayor feels like someone isnt fit for their position, or shows clear wrongdoing or insubordination, the Mayor has all right to remove that person from their position as outlined in the City Charter in Section III. 

The Mayor felt the appellant was clearly showing insubordination thereby being removed from his/her position as the City Attorney. The appellant posted a public release speaking in his/her official capacity as the City Attorney. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms states every citizen of British Columbia have the right to freedom of thought, belief, opinion and expression, but that doesn't overrule what the City Charter states in Section 4 of the Mayoral Powers to remove any Individual from their position if deemed to be reasonable.

  *As to question 2 -- we say that the mayor has exclusive discretion dismiss his staff with cause.*
    
  *Relief claimed under Rule 2.1 is denied.*
