**JOINT REASONS FOR JUDGEMENT**

*By the Court:*
  
We are all of the view of dismissing the appeal. The trial judge's factual findings are not reviewable on appeal. The law was correctly applied; a claim which pemises on moderation action is not reviewable. We agree substantially with the reasons of iiCryptic_LawMD, J.
