*By the Court:*

  Whereas the appeal stands unopposed by all respondents, we need not perform any further analysis. We accept that the trial judge abused his discretion when he failed to hold a show cause hearing before summarily convicting the appellant for contempt of court. Accordingly, the appeal is allowed and the appellant's convictions are set aside.
