*Per curiam:*

Judicial review of administrative decisions, such as adjudications of the Department of Business Affairs, is governed by *Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov*, 2019 SCC 65. For review of the truth of the allegations sustaining the respondent’s adjudication, the standard of review is “reasonableness”. The court must therefore consider whether or not the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of facts and law. For review on questions of law, the standard of review is “correctness” in order to maintain consistent answers to questions of law.

**We hold that, on the questions of fact:**
- Deference is given to the adjudicating body on the sum of its findings of fact.

**We hold that, on the questions of law:**
- The Department of Business Affairs lacks jurisdiction to restrict a business’ speech to the extent that the speech is genuine opinion.
- The Department of Business Affairs acted *ultra vires* to the extent that it sanctioned the applicant for speech.
- A business’ internal processes to address misconduct of its employees does not change the authority of the Department of Business Affairs to issue its proper sanctions. 
- Timely and good faith resolution by a business is a mitigating factor that the Department of Business Affairs must consider, and in the whole of the circumstances, the disciplinary sanctions issued by the Department of Business Affairs were reasonable.
- The Department of Business Affairs is entitled to sanction a business for the conduct of its individual employees notwithstanding whether that conduct was or was not within the control of the business owner. (See generally *Commercial Transportation Act*, RSBC 1996, c. 58; see also authority of Commercial Vehicle Safety and Enforcement agency to fine companies as a whole due to its operators violating height limits for commercial vehicles).
- No law requires the Department of Business Affairs to take statements under oath. The President of the Department of Business Affairs is entitled to determine the appropriate venue for taking statements. A statement taken in a setting different than that directed by the President is generally not sufficient to sustain a procedural violation for which remand is the appropriate relief without a showing of palpable and overriding error.
- Suggestions that the adjudicators of the Department of Business Affairs were prejudiced were not substantiated. Appearance of bias or actual bias is not a reverse-onus claim.

**It is hereby ordered that:**
- The adjudication of the Department of Business Affairs, being reasonable in the whole of the circumstances, is sustained.
- Policy 1.31 of the Department of Business Affairs, for lack of jurisdiction, is declared to be of no force or effect.

*iiCryptic_LawMD J. concurring:*

-  The Government decision is reasonable because the appellant has not established an objective form of reasonableness, and has not proven that their decision is within an unreasonable action.
- The appellant gives no actual procedure for which the review is based. So we cannot accurately decide whether the punishment is acceptable or not.
