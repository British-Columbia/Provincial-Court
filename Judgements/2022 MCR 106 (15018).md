**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**
	
The petitioner, Bespin_Cartier, claims that iiState_Law1 & BreadbinUrie falsely arrested her/him. BreadbinUrie was later dismissed as a defendant due to not being in any department related to vancouver and because his discord information couldn't be found.
	
The defendant, iiState_Law1, failed to provide the courts with a reply within a timeframe set, therefore I'm moving for default judgement in favour of the petitioner.

- As to claim 1, the plaintiff wants 20,000 in-game dollars in relief.
	- The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff 20,000 in-game dollars.
	
- As to claim 2, the plaintiff wants 20,000 in-game dollars in relief.
	- The defendant is ordered to pay the plaintiff 20,000 in-game dollars.
