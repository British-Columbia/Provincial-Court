**INTRODUCTION**

[1] The Petitioner inuirty brought a civil case before me, accusing the Defendant Bespin_Cartier of Assault.

**REASONS FOR RULING**

[2] The Petitioner's three exhibits that they are using simply lack any positive POID (Proof of Identification), and thus cannot clearly prove that the Defendant Bespin_Cartier was at fault; and

[3] The Petitioner's three exhibits are simply photographs of what happened and not an entire video that could help show what truly did happen.

**RULING ON THE CASE**

[4] A directed verdict is entered and the case is dismissed with prejudice.
