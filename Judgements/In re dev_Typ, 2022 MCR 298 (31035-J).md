**BACKGROUND**

The application for a writ of *mandamus* and the notice of claim was jointly filed by applicant dev_Typ on the basis of violation of rights and negligence. Violation of rights is derived from the *Revised Employee Rights By-law* and negligence is a claimable tort derived from the *Torts Act*. The disciplinary action issued to the applicant has since been revoked, and the applicant does not claim as remedy the reversal of any disciplinary records. In my view, this lack of injury prevents the applicant from pursuing a civil claim under s. 2(f) of the *Revised Employee Rights By-law*. In this case, applicant alleges additional injury in the form of violation of rights and negligence by respondents. Applicant claims that he is entitled to a writ of *mandamus* to direct the respondents to create policies for the Human Resources Complaints Commission (the “Commission”) and a review of all terminations issued by the Commission. I agree that such an order can only be issued by way of *mandamus*. Respondents Shellykeepers and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police now moves to dismiss the writ of *mandamus* and the notice of claim.

***MANDAMUS* PRINCIPLES**

Since the issues raised by respondents concern the availability of orders in the nature of *mandamus*, I would clarify the several principal requirements must be satisfied before *mandamus* will issue. The following general framework was set out by Robertson, J.A. in *Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)*, [1994] 1 F.C. 742. This framework finds support in the extant jurisprudence of the Federal Court and Supreme Court of Canada (see generally *Apotex Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)*, [1994] 3 SCR 1100; and *CUPE, Air Canada Component v. Canada (Labour)*, 2012 FC 1484). 

1. **There must be a public legal duty to act:** *Minister of Employment and Immigration v. Hudnik*, [1980] 1 F.C. 180.

2. **The duty must be owed to the applicant:** Generally, the rule is that *mandamus* cannot issue with respect to a duty owed to the Crown. Historically, this issue has been framed as one concerning standing to bring a *mandamus* application. The Supreme Court has considerably loosened the requirements for standing: *Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada et al.*, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 138.

3. **There is a clear right to performance of that duty, in particular:**
  
	(a) **the applicant has satisfied all conditions precedent giving rise to the duty:** *Nguyen v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)*, [1994] 1 F.C. 232; and *Hutchins v. Canada (National Parole Board)*, [1993] 3 F.C. 505.

	(b) **there was (i) a prior demand for performance of the duty; (ii) a reasonable time to comply with the demand unless refused outright; and (iii) a subsequent refusal which can be either expressed or implied, e.g. unreasonable delay**: *O'Grady v. Whyte*, [1983] 1 F.C. 719, citing *Canadian Wildlife Federation Inc. v. Canada (Minister of the Environment)*, [1989] 3 F.C. 309.

4. **Where the duty sought to be enforced is discretionary, the following rules apply:**

	(a) **in exercising a discretion, the decision-maker must not act in a manner which can be characterized as "unfair", "oppressive" or demonstrate "flagrant impropriety" or "bad faith";**

	(b) ***mandamus* is unavailable if the decision-maker's discretion is characterized as being "unqualified", "absolute", "permissive" or "unfettered";**

	(c) **in the exercise of a "fettered" discretion, the decision-maker must act upon "relevant", as opposed to "irrelevant", considerations;**

	(d) ***mandamus* is unavailable to compel the exercise of a "fettered discretion" in a particular way; and**

	(e) ***mandamus* is only available when the decision-maker's discretion is "spent"; i.e., the applicant has a vested right to the performance of the duty.**

See *Restrictive Trade Practices Commission v. Director of Investigation and Research, Combines Investigation Act*, [1983] 2 F.C. 222; *Apotex Inc. v. Attorney General of Canada et al.*, (1986), 11 C.P.R. (3d) 43 (FC); *Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. v. Government of Canada*, [1980] 2 F.C. 458; *Jefford v. Canada*, [1988] 2 F.C. 189; *Merck & Co. Inc. v. Sherman & Ulster Ltd., Attorney-General of Canada, Intervenant*, [1982] 1 SCR 726; *Distribution Canada Inc. v. M.N.R.*, [1991] 1 F.C. 716; and *Kahlon v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)*, [1986] 3 F.C. 386.

5. **No other adequate remedy is available to the applicant:** *Carota v. Jamieson*, [1979] 1 F.C. 735; *Maple Lodge Farms Ltd. v. Government of Canada, supra*; Jefford v. Canada, supra; *Harelkin v. University of Regina*, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 561; and see *Canada (Auditor General) v. Canada (Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources)*, [1987] 1 F.C. 406; appeal dismissed 1989 CanLII 73 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 49.

6. **The order sought will be of some practical value or effect:** *Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport)*, [1990] 2 F.C. 18, per Stone J.A., at pages 48-52; affd [1992] 1 S.C.R. 3, per La Forest J., at pages 76-80; *Landreville v. The Queen*, [1973] F.C. 1223; and *Beauchemin v. Employment and Immigration Commission of Canada* (1987), 15 F.T.R. 83 (FC).

7. **The Court in the exercise of its discretion finds no equitable bar to the relief sought:** *Penner v. Electoral Boundaries Commission (Ont.)*, [1976] 2 F.C. 614; and *Friends of the Oldman River Society v. Canada (Minister of Transport), supra*.

8. **On a "balance of convenience" an order in the nature of *mandamus* should (or should not) issue.**

**ANALYSIS**

In this application, it is understood the Crown had a duty to act which was owed to dev_Typ. s. 2(f) of the *Revised Employee Rights By-law* does indeed impose a duty on the Crown to “overturn the action and update the employee’s record as necessary” if “any action is determined to be false or in violation of employment law”. According to both parties, that duty was fulfilled even before the filing of the application. dev_Typ takes the position that an additional duty exists in the nature of mandatory reform and revision. Applicant submits that that duty is derived from the general wording of the *Revised Employee Rights By-law*, which imposes liability on the Crown for unlawful disciplinary action. 

Before remedy in the nature of *mandamus* can be given, the applicant must make a claim that, if assumed to be true, gives the applicant clear right to performance of that duty. The duty whose performance it is sought to coerce by *mandamus* must be actually due and incumbent upon the officer at the time of seeking the relief, and the writ will not lie to compel the doing of an act which he is not yet under obligation to perform: *O'Grady v. Whyte, supra*, p. 44. While I accept applicant’s view that the *Revised Employee Rights By-law* does not “limit” relief, I do not accept that *mandamus* may issue absent of an explicit right to performance of that duty.

**CONCLUSION**

I will dismiss the application.
