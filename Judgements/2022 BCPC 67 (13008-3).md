**FACTUAL BACKGROUND**
	
Petitioner, Acropolistis, alleges that defendant, shviapillips, violated his rights and public law for failing to provide a suervisor upon request consistent with Executive Order #3. Defendant pleas liable to the factual allegations for both torts but disputes the relief requested for tort 2.
	
**RELIEF CALCULATIONS AND ORDERS**
	
As to tort 1, defendant pleads liable and agrees to pay all the relief requested. Defendant, shviapillips, is therefore ordered to pay petitioner, Acropolistis, the sum of one hundred thounsand dollars ($100000.00) in punitive damages by wire transfer, cash, cheque, or any other method agreed upon by the parties within 48 hours of the publication of this judgement.
	
As to tort 2, defendant pleads liable but does not agree to the relief requested. Petitioner requests that equitable relief in form of a prohibitory injunction is issued against defendant to bar him from employment in a law enforcement agency for three months. Petitioner has made no effort to justify this request; it is therefore denied.  Defendant, shviapillips, is therefore ordered to pay petitioner, Acropolistis, the sum of one dollar ($1.00) in nominal damages by wire transfer, cash, cheque, or any other method agreed upon by the parties within 48 hours of the publication of this judgement.
