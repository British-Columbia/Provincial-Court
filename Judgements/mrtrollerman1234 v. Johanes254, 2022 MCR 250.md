**DEFAULT ORDER**
	
In this matter, defendant Johanes254 failed to file a Reply to the Notice of Claim within the time period required. Accordingly, default is entered to the claims of Assault, Battery, Negligence, and False Arrest due to the defendant's noncompliance with Rule 1.7. When a matter is defaulted, the defendant is assumed to not contest any of the facts plead by the claimant in the Notice of Claim and I will assume all facts plead are true.
  
The petitioner mrtrollerman1234 makes valid claims that makes one reasonably believe that Assault and Battery was in fact committed against the petitoner. The court though does believe that the defendant was justified in detaining the petitioner and therefore denies the claims and relief requested for the claims of negligence and false arrest.

The claims and reliefs for False Arrest are denied.
	
The claims and reliefs for Negligence are denied.
	
The claims and reliefs for Assault and Battery is granted and the defendant is ordered to write a 100 word appology letter to the petitioner within one week from this order.
