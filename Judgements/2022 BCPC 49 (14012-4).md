**BACKGROUND ON PROCEEDINGS**

Counsel for the petitioner, on behalf of the petitioner, filed a civil action to this court on January 25, 2022. Petitioner's Notice of Claim (Court File No. 14012-1) was accepted on January 25, 2022. Petitioner, coolandonplays, alleges unlawful disciplinary action and deprivation of rights arising out of a claim against defendants, mallyvibes and lepa1234567, and co-defendants, the Vancouver Police Department and Emergency Response Team, on January 5, 2022. An amended Notice of Claim (Court File No. 14012-2) was filed and accepted on the same day and resulted in lepa1234567 being dismissed as defendant. The Notice of Claim claims that defendant and co-defendants did not provide a proper disciplinary action document for the purposes of the *[Revised] Employee Rights Act of 2021* and that they took unlawful disciplinary action against petitioner. 

Defendant, on behalf of himself and co-defendants, appeared before the court on January 25, 2022 and produced a Reply (Court File No. 14012-3) denying all claims, which was accepted on the same day. 

The court entered into pre-trial discovery on January 25, 2022 and terminated it on the same day by consent of all parties. [Exhibits](https://github.com/koala4lif/Provincial-Court-of-British-Columbia/blob/main/Exhibits/14012.pdf) produced during discovery were entered onto the record and admitted as evidence.  

On January 25, 2022, defendant, on behalf of himself and co-defendants, moved for dismissal with prejudice. I denied that motion.
	
On January 26, 2022, counsel for the petitioner presented his opening statements. I followed with some questions directed to counsel; satisfactory answers were obtained.

On January 26 and 27, 2022, the court waited on opening statements from the defendant and co-defendants. They were never provided.
	
On January 28, 2022, counsel for the defendant, on behalf of the defendant and co-defendants, modified their plea as to tort (1) to liable and stated they would provide the relief claimed in tort (1). The court sees no reason to reject a modified plea. On the same day, counsel for the petitioner withdrew petitioner's claims as to tort (2). 
	
As it stands, all parties have effectively settled.  

**ORDER**

I will order that relief agreed to by defendant, on behalf of himself and co-defendants, be allowed, as follows.
  
Defendant, mallyvibes, and co-defendants, the Vancouver Police Department and Emergency Response Team, is ordered to reinstate petitioner, coolandonplays, to the position and rank of Commanding Officer of the Emergency Response Team, a subsidiary of the Vancouver Police Department.
   
Any person who is able to carry out any orders set out in this judgement may carry out such orders on behalf of the defendant and co-defendants without penalty. The orders contained within this judgement take effect immediately and must additionally be fulfilled by January 29, 2022.
  
Petitioner's claims as to tort (2) are dismissed; relief denied.
