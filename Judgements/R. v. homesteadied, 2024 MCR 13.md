**Introduction**

On the 13th of February 2024, the Crown accused the defendant, homesteadied, of four counts:

- x1 Count of Reckless Discharging a Firearm (Indictable);
- x1 Count of Discharging a firearm with intent to wound (Indictable);
- x1 Count of Unlawfully causing bodily harm (Indictable); and
- x1 Count of First Degree Murder (Indictable)

The defendant pleads not-guilty to all counts.

**Finding of the Facts**

To begin, the Crown argues that “...the accused utilizing their department-issued firearms in a manner that is not only inconsistent with the duties and responsibilities entrusted to them but also in direct violation of the laws and regulations governing the use of such lethal force.” In Exhibit A it is clear that this is the case and that this did occur. However, when looking at the defendant’s argument of, “In Exhibit A, you can see that my client was fearing for his life. You can also see that at timestamp 00:20, suspect Cqrrlvss proceeded to shoot at my client FIRST, and then my client proceeded to shoot to kill Cqrrlvss as he was being shot at. He only did such in self-defense.” When analyzing the video, the claims that the “suspect” did indeed shoot first, however, it must be noted that the video starts off with both parties having their weapons drawn. Now, in a sworn affidavit by iiLittle_Law, they claim that they knew it was a “1v1,” implying that both of the parties involved also knew it was a 1v1. This in turn invalidates the defendant’s argument.

When looking at count 1, what must happen to justify the offense is “intentionally discharges a firearm while being reckless as to the life or safety of another person.” The defendant intentionally discharged a firearm while acting recklessly in regards to the life of another person.

When looking at count 2, what must happen to justify the offense is “...who discharges a firearm at a person with intent to wound…any person.” The defendant knowingly participated in an event that in the end had the intent to wound another person.

When looking at count 3, what must happen to justify the offense is “...causes bodily harm to any person during the commission of another offence.” The court already found the defendant in violation of two other offenses, thus this did occur, as the defendant caused bodily harm to another person while committing another offense.

When looking at count 4, what must happen to justify the offense is “...it is planned and deliberate”. The criteria is met as the 1v1 was planned and deliberate.

**Judgement**

With all of these facts in mind, the court finds the defendant **GUILTY** on all counts.

**Sentence**

  - For Count 1, (x1), s. 87, the defendant is sentenced to 20 minutes (1200 seconds) in a Correctional Facility, remanded to the custody of the Correctional Service Canada.

  - For Count 2, (x1), s. 86, the defendant is sentenced to 20 minutes (1200 seconds) in a Correctional Facility, remanded to the custody of the Correctional Service Canada.

  - For Count 3, (x1), s. 92, the defendant is sentenced to 20 minutes (1200 seconds) in a Correctional Facility, remanded to the custody of the Correctional Service Canada.

  - For Count 4, (x1), s. 81, the defendant is sentenced to 45 minutes (2700 seconds) in a Correctional Facility, remanded to the custody of the Correctional Service Canada.

Furthermore, as the defendant prematurely left the Provincial Court of British Columbia's Discord Server, they will be charged with Disobeying order of court:

  - For Disobeying order of court, (x1), s. 55, the defendant is sentenced to 15 minutes (900 seconds) in a Correctional Facility, remanded to the custody of the Correctional Service Canada.

Each sentence imposed shall be served concurrently, for a total of 120 minutes (7200 seconds). 

**Additional Order**

WEAPONS PROHIBITION ORDER: The defendant is prohibited from selling, manufacturing, handling, or otherwise being in the possession of Firearms, expiring 05/08/2024 (MM/DD/YYYY). FAILURE TO ABIDE BY THIS ORDER WILL RESULT IN CRIMINAL SANCTIONS.
