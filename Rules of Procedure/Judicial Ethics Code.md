## Judicial Ethics Code

## 1. Foreword

1. The ability of the legal system to function effectively depends in large part on the ethical standards of our judges. The adoption of a widely accepted ethical frame of reference ensures that judges and the public alike are aware of the principles by which judges should be guided. 

2. The purpose of this document is to provide ethical guidance for judges.

## 2. Judicial Independence 

1. An independent judiciary is indispensable to impartial justice under law. Judges should, therefore, uphold and exemplify judicial independence in both its individual and institutional aspects.

2. Judges must exercise their judicial functions independently and free of extraneous influence. 

3. Judges must firmly reject any attempt to influence their decisions in any matter before the Court outside the proper process of the Court. 

4. Judges should encourage and uphold arrangements and safeguards to maintain and enhance the institutional and operational independence of the judiciary. 

5. Judges should exhibit and promote high standards of judicial conduct so as to reinforce public confidence which is the cornerstone of judicial independence.

## 3. Integrity

1. Judges should strive to conduct themselves with integrity so as to sustain and enhance public confidence in the judiciary.

2. Judges should make every effort to ensure that their conduct is above reproach in the view of reasonable, fair minded and informed persons. 

3. Judges, in addition to observing this high standard personally, should encourage and support its observance by their judicial colleagues.

## 4. Diligence

1. Judges should be diligent in the performance of their judicial duties.

2. Judges should devote their professional activity to judicial duties broadly defined, which include not only presiding in court and making decisions, but other judicial tasks essential to the court’s operation. 

3. Judges should take reasonable steps to maintain and enhance the knowledge, skills and personal qualities necessary for judicial office. 

4. Judges should endeavour to perform all judicial duties, including the delivery of reserved judgments, with reasonable promptness. 

5. Judges should not engage in conduct incompatible with the diligent discharge of judicial duties or condone such conduct in colleagues.

6. Diligence in the performance of adjudicative duties includes striving for impartial and even-handed application of the law, thoroughness, decisiveness, promptness and the prevention of abuse of the process and improper treatment of witnesses.


## 5. Equality

1. Judges should conduct themselves and proceedings before them so as to assure equality according to law.

2. Judges should carry out their duties with appropriate consideration for all persons such as parties, witnesses, court personnel and judicial colleagues without discrimination. 

3. Judges should avoid membership in any organization that they know currently practices any form of discrimination that contravenes the law. 

4. Judges, in the course of proceedings before them, should disassociate themselves from and disapprove of clearly irrelevant comments or conduct by court staff, counsel or any other person subject to the judge’s direction which demonstrate discrimination on grounds prohibited by law.

5. While doing whatever is possible to prevent unfair disadvantage to the unrepresented party, the judge must be careful to preserve his or her impartiality.

## 6. Impartiality

1. Judges must be and should appear to be impartial with respect to their decisions and decision making. 

2. Judges should strive to ensure that their conduct, both in and out of court, maintains and enhances confidence in their impartiality and that of the judiciary. 

3. Judges should as much as reasonably possible conduct their personal and business affairs so as to minimize the occasions on which it will be necessary to be disqualified from hearing cases.

4. The appearance of impartiality is to be assessed from the perspective of a reasonable, fair minded and informed person. 

5. While acting decisively, maintaining firm control of the process and ensuring expedition, judges should treat everyone before the court with appropriate courtesy.

6. Judges should avoid any activity or association that could reflect adversely on their impartiality or interfere with the performance of judicial duties.

7. Judges should avoid involvement in causes or organizations that are likely to be engaged in litigation. 

8. Judges should not give legal or investment advice. 

9. Judges should refrain from conduct such as membership in groups or organizations or participation in public discussion which, in the mind of a reasonable, fair minded and informed person, would undermine confidence in a judge’s impartiality with respect to issues that could come before the courts.

10. All partisan political activity must cease upon appointment. Judges should refrain from conduct that, in the mind of a reasonable, fair minded and informed person, could give rise to the appearance that the judge is engaged in political activity. 

11. Judges should refrain from membership in political parties and political fund raising; attendance at political gatherings and political fund raising events; contributing to political parties or campaigns; taking part publicly in controversial political discussions except in respect of matters directly affecting the operation of the courts, the independence of the judiciary or fundamental aspects of the administration of justice; and signing petitions to influence a political decision. 

12. Although anyone who merely knows a judge has every right to be politically active, judges should recognize that such activities of these people may, even if erroneously, adversely affect the public perception of a judge’s impartiality. In any case before the court in which there could reasonably be such a perception, the judge should not sit. 

13. Judges should disqualify themselves in any case in which they believe they will be unable to judge impartially.

14. Judges should disqualify themselves in any case in which they believe that a reasonable, fair minded and informed person would have a reasoned suspicion of conflict between a judge’s personal interest and a judge’s duty. 

15. Disqualification is not appropriate if the matter giving rise to the perception of a possibility of conflict is trifling or would not support a plausible argument in favour of disqualification, or no other tribunal can be constituted to deal with the case or, because of urgent circumstances, failure to act could lead to a miscarriage of justice.
