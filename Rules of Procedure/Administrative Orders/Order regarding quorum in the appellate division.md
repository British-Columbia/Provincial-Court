	Title: 		Order regarding quorum in the appellate division
	Effective: 	20221127
	Authority: 	Vancouver Charter, art. 4, s. 2(a)

---

Cases in the appellate may proceed and be heard without a quorum of three panel judges, but no decison may be entered but in a manner consistent with the *Vancouver Charter*, which requires a majority of three panel judges to agree; all judgements in the appellate division must be reserved until two or more judges agree on the opinion filed by the presiding judge.

This order is intended to supersede appellate divison rules to the extent necessary only.
