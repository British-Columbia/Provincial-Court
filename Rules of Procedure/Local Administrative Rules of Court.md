    - `1` for civil matters;
    - `2` for criminal matters;
    - `3` for applications and all other matters in the Trial Division; and
    - `4` for all matters in the Appellate Division.

Every Court and judge, and every person having, by law or consent of parties, authority to hear and receive evidence, has power to administer the following oath to every witness who is legally called to give evidence before that Court, judge or person: `I swear that the evidence to be given by me shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God.`

A witness may, instead of taking an oath, make the following solemn affirmation: `I solemnly affirm that the evidence to be given by me shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.`

Where a witness makes a solemn affirmation, his evidence shall be taken and have the same effect as if taken under oath.

The panel shall be dissolved once all matters have finally been disposed of.
